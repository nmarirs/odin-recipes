    <h3>About the dish</h3>
    <p><em><q>When life gives you Plutonium-239, make the Atomic Sandwich</q></em></p>
    <p>
        The Atomic Sandwich was inspired by a trip to [INFORMATION REDACTED] where our chefs witnessed the testing of the [INFORMATION REDACTED].
        Enjoy this sandwich as the Pu-239 decays with flavor into Uranium, Actinium, Bismuth, Francium and a plethora of other elements. Complete
        with our special Nuclear Fallout Cream and Mushroom Clouds, its safe to say that you will never need another sandwich after you try this one.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread</li>
        <li>Freshly prepared Nuclear Fallout Cream</li>
        <li>Polonium-239 sourced from your local nuclear weapons storage facility (Other isotopes work just fine but our chefs really like this one)</li>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Dried Mushroom Clouds</li>
        <li>Radioactive water from your local nuclear power plant</li>
        <li>Optional: White phosphorous</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Tip: Keep an army of your own on standby if the defense authorities of your state happen to pay a visit</em>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gently place 1 Dried Mushroom Cloud into a bowl of radioactive water. Leave it aside to swell to the size advertised on the package.</li>
        <li>Grill the bread to your liking</li>
        <li>Spread Nuclear Fallout Cream on both slices of bread</li>
        <li>Take a slice of bread and put 4-5 spheres of Pu-239 on it.</li>
        <li>Add some cabbage on top. This step is absolutely vital to the final taste of the sandwich</li>
        <li>Cut a few tomato slices and add them to your sandwich</li>
        <li>Close the sandwich</li>
        <li>Gently remove your Mushroom Cloud from the water and place it on top of the sandwich</li>
        <li>Optional: Gently remove a few pieces of  phosphorous from storage. Dry them out and place them on top of the sandwich</li>
        <li>Voila! You are done. The Plutonium-239 has a half life of about 24,100 years so calculate your decay rate to get it finish eating it by then!</li>
    </ol>
