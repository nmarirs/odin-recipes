    <h3>About the dish</h3>
    <p><em><q>To be a donut, or not to be a donut, that is the question</q></em></p>
    <p>
        Well even we are not sure. It kinda just phases into existence and vanishes after you take a bite. Some say the donut will appear
        before you and your next of kin till the end of time.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A regular donut</li>
        <li>A cardboard box</li>
        <li>Radioactive isotope of your choice</li>
        <li>Mr.Donut's special Mystery Donut glaze<sup>TM</sup> (avaiable only at select retailers)</li>
        <li>Spare microwave</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Did you know: We contemplated naming this Schrodinger's Donut, but it just isn't the same y'know.</em>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Unpack Mr.Donut's speical Mystery Donut glaze<sup>TM</sup> and microwave the bottle. Do note that the microwave will explode, take
            adequate precautions.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the bottle, safely,from the now unusable microwave and unscrew the cap.</li>
        <li>Apply the glaze on your donut. We recommend using the entire bottle.</li>
        <li>Place the donut in your cardboard box. Seal the box.</li>
        <li>Close the box and never open it ever again. Store it someplace safe so that it doesn't accidentally open.</li>
        <li>If everything worked right, you should be seeing a donut appear before you in a few min. Take a bite, and it will disappear!</li>
        <li>
            Note: The donut will <u>NOT</u> go away until you take a bite. But you could delay its appearance by hurling insults at it (the donut
            will question its existence). It also find a way to replenish itself, thank the <s>enslaved</s> volunteer scientists at Mr.Donut for that!
