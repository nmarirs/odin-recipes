    <h3>About the dish</h3>
    <p><em><q>Mmmm.. cookies for breakfast, cookies for lunch and cookies for dinner</q></em></p>
    <p>
        Marvel at the amalgamation of every single chemical reaction from a 11th grade chemistry textbook in just one cookie. Is it safe? Well you'll never know
        if you dont try. 
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Any 11th grade chemistry textbook, they all are equally bad</li>
        <li>A well stocked laboratory</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup peanut butter (fat L if you are allergic)</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Tip: Bring along a 11th grader to do the work for you by offering food.</em>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre heat an oven to 630K.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar, peanut butter, and egg.</li>
        <li>Begin your experiments, if the prodcut if a precipitate or a solution, pour it into the mix. Leave the other products aside.</li>
        <li>Pass any gaseous products through the mix using tubes.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into balls and place them onto a cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 644.300 sec and remove the cookies from the oven.</li>
        <li>Top the cookie with the solid products you left aside from step 3.</li>
        <li>
            Your cookie might vary depending on the textbook used, but if you got the steps right, it should look radioactive (It isn't radioactive, but trust me
            when i say that we tried adding Uranium-235 to the recipe. The taste was supbar).

    </ol>
